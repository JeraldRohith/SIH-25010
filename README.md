## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
We propose SmartBioFarm, an AI-powered Digital Farm Management Portal designed to digitally implement and monitor Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms.
This portal will help farmers automate daily farm operations, ensure compliance with hygiene standards, prevent disease outbreaks, and track livestock health efficiently.

The solution integrates IoT sensors, AI-based analytics, and a cloud-based management system to enable real-time monitoring, predictive health alerts, and digital record-keeping — all accessible through a web and mobile interface.

## Technical Approach

The proposed system integrates IoT, AI, and cloud technologies to implement and monitor biosecurity in pig and poultry farms.
IoT sensors collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, and air quality, while farmers log feed, vaccination, and hygiene details through a mobile app.
This data is processed using AI and machine learning models to predict disease risks and ensure compliance with biosecurity standards.
The cloud-based dashboard displays analytics, sends alerts for abnormalities, and generates automated reports for authorities.
The system ensures data security, scalability, and multilingual support, making it suitable for farms of all sizes across India.

## Feasibility and Viability

Technical Feasibility: The solution uses proven technologies (IoT, AI, Cloud) that can be easily implemented using low-cost sensors and open-source platforms.

Economic Viability: The system is cost-effective — suitable for small and medium farms, with optional premium modules for large farms.

Operational Feasibility: Simple user interface available in local languages, allowing rural farmers to operate it easily.

Scalability: Modular architecture supports integration with government APIs, veterinary departments, and insurance systems.

Sustainability: Promotes long-term disease prevention, reducing livestock mortality and improving profitability


## Impact and Benefits

Enhanced Biosecurity: Continuous monitoring ensures strict hygiene and access control.

Reduced Disease Outbreaks: AI-based early detection helps prevent major losses.

Data-Driven Farming: Real-time analytics empower farmers to make informed decisions.

Economic Upliftment: Increases productivity, reduces losses, and enhances export potential.

Traceability and Transparency: QR-based tracking improves trust in meat and poultry supply chains.

Government Support: Enables real-time data reporting to veterinary and agricultural departments for disease control initiatives.

Environmental Impact: Promotes sustainable farming through optimized feed and waste management.
